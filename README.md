# unikit-android
Welcome to my products trading app for students!
I used android studio and php as my backend. 
In order to run it, add the files fround in the unikit-backend repository to your htdocs folder in mamp/xampp and import the sql files into the database in phpmyadmin. 

Please Note that inside MainActivity and MainActivitySignUp and ItemPage there is a String URL that starts with "http://192.168.86.198/Unikit-Final/...." . The part after "http://" should be of the format 192.168.x.x consisting of your local ip address where the last 2 numbers are obtained by running the "netstat" or "ipconfig/all" command in command prompt or terminal.
